# Audit Findings — Lab Talk Prep

**Status:** Prior recorded; audit pending.

## Prior (written before audit, 2026-04-26)

What I currently expect the audit to find:

### Greens (expected to hold up)
- Bootstrap CIs (BCa, B=10000) — Exp 43 onwards used the rigorous protocol consistently.
- Multi-seed averaging-before-bootstrap — implemented post-Bouthillier.
- CV-tuned probes (`GridSearchCV` on C/alpha) — Exp 43 onwards.
- Pooled disorder ρ + cluster bootstrap — Exp 43 fix.
- 5-PLM Exp 46 splits — same partition across PLMs by construction (single split, embeddings re-extracted).

### Yellows (expected to need clarification, not fixes)
- Disorder retention 94.9 % — real, but the floor (raw 1024d) and the noise of probes need to be co-reported.
- ANKH disorder retention 94.8 % — same caveat.
- DCT K=4 — chosen empirically; need a one-line "why not K=8" answer.
- The receiver-side "no codebook" claim for binary — needs a clean demo (decoder uses `h5py + numpy` only, nothing from `OneEmbeddingCodec`).

### Reds (expected to require fixes or honest demotion)
- `one_embedding/` package referenced in CLAUDE.md / MEMORY.md but not at repo root → confirm location, fix references everywhere.
- Modified phylo file (n_taxa 156→24) → recover or document the canonical run.
- Possibly: a few claims in CLAUDE.md / README without a traced source experiment.
- Possibly: dead code, TODO/FIXME markers in `src/`.
- Possibly: pytest failures in the current state (we have not run the full suite recently).

### Predicted distribution
~70 % green, ~20 % yellow, ~10 % red.
